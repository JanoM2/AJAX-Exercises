Are you a JavaScript developer looking for free webspace to host your project?  
Check out [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). To make things perfect we provide you with a free and sleek URL like one of these:

[_https://.js.org_](_https://.js.org_)

Your page just has to _provide some reasonable content with a clear connection to JavaScript!_ Follow these four steps to get your own free JS.ORG subdomain for your GitHub Page:

### 1

If you haven't already, now it's time to log in to your GitHub account and set up your GitHub Page by following the instructions [here](https://pages.github.com/ "GitHub Pages"). To get a head start you can simply use the generator with one of the provided themes and add some content to your new page.

### 2

Now you should determine your js.org subdomain: either choose your username or the name of your repo according to the existing GitHub Pages URL (for http://foo.github.io/bar, either "foo.js.org" or "bar.js.org" would be possible). More details in the [wiki](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/wiki "JS.ORG's Wiki").

### 3

Add a file named "CNAME" to your repo (in the "gh-pages" branch for project pages) with a single line matching the domain you have chosen (e.g. "foo.js.org" without quotes). If you face any problems, check out the section about [Custom URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/#creating-and-committing-a-cname-file "GitHub Pages Help") at GitHub Pages Help.

### 4

To finish the procedure, make a pull request in our GitHub [repository](https://github.com/js-org/js.org/tree/master "JS.ORGs repository") that adds your subdomain to the list of existing JS.ORG domains. Your new URL should go live within 24 hours (keep an eye on your pull request in case of a naming conflict or a question from our side).

Looks like your ad blocker worked.  
This would have been a paid advertisement that meets the [Acceptable Ads Standard](https://acceptableads.com/standard/ "Acceptable Ads Standard").

\_Important_As the owner of the repository, you keep complete control over your published content. But that also means that all rights and duties that come along with publishing a website remain in your responsibility.
